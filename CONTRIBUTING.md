## Releases

Releases for `dependency-file-generator` are handled by [semantic-release][semantic-release]. To ensure that every commit on the `main` branch has a semantic commit message, the following settings have been configured:

- Only squash commits are allowed
- The default squash commit message is derived from the pull-request's title and body
- Pull request titles are required to be semantic commit messages

The table below (from [semantic-release][semantic-release] docs) shows the types of changes that correspond to each release type.

| Commit message                                                                                                                                                                                   | Release type                                                                                    |

If a change type not listed in the table above is used, it will not trigger a release. For example:

- `docs: fix README type`
- `ci: update GHAs workflow`
- `chore: some miscellaneous work`

The `angular` preset is used by default, which is documented [here](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-angular).
